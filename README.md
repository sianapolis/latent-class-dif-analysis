# Latent Class DIF Analysis - Simulation and Experimental Demonstration

This is a repo for curious statisticians who are interested in latent class or latent differential item functioning (DIF) effects. For an explanation of the model as well as the usage of the package, please see `Two Class Latent DIF Experimental Demonstration - Explanation.ipynb`.

Feel free to test it out, and of course, any feedback is welcome!
